The main idea of the get_next_line project is to implement a C function that reads and returns a single line from a file descriptor each time it is called, while handling incomplete reads, memory management, and edge cases efficiently. The function is designed to work without prior knowledge of the file size and can handle varying buffer sizes dynamically.
